Resistor color watchface for Pebble Time

[![Available on the Pebble App Store](http://pblweb.com/badge/55561ff444dad6e1470000df/orange/medium/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unwiredben/resistor-time.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/unwiredben/resistor-time)

This shows the current time as a resistor with the color code matching the time of day in 24-hour time.

This only works on the Basalt color platform, as there's no point trying to show color codes on a black and white watch.

Version 1.1 adds an app config screen on the phone to switch between green, black, and white background colors.
